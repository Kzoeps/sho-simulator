# About
Sho-simulator, simulates the tradition of playing sho when you visit Lhakhangs. You can choose the number of times you want to simulate the sho
and it will give you a result of the number of sho zangmi and sho mazangmi. 

The numbers for sho zangmi and mazangmi are from Dechenphug Lhakhang. Personally requested from the koenyer, the lucky set of numbers are:
{3,5,7,8,9,11,13,14,17,18}. So yes this is actually a legit source, go ask the koenyer if you dont believe me.

The program simulates three dice rolls for three times until you get a sho zangmi. And if after even three tries you still end up
getting a the unlucky set of numbers then you officially get a sho mazangmi. 

For the simulation users can run how many ever your computer can handle but it is interesting to note that as the number of simulation increases, the number of sho zangmi and mazagnmi move closer to the expected value(LLN).
